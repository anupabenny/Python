1.	Import the multiprocessing module:

This line imports the multiprocessing module, which provides support for creating and managing processes.

2.	Define the worker function:
 
This function takes a chunk of data and a multiprocessing queue (bds_result_queue). It calculates the sum of the numbers in the chunk and puts the partial result into the queue.

3.	Define the main function:
 
The main function is where the main logic of the script is implemented.

4.	Generate a large array of numbers:
 
This line creates a list containing numbers from 1 to 100,000. This array represents the data that will be processed in parallel.

5.	Define the number of processes and calculate the chunk size:
 
Here, the script is configured to use number of CPU in system, and the chunk size is calculated based on the length of the array and the number of processes.

6.	Split the large array into chunks:
 
This line creates a list of chunks, where each chunk contains a subset of the original data array.

7.	Create a multiprocessing Queue for collecting results:
 
A multiprocessing queue (bds_result_queue) is created to store the partial results from each process.

8.	Create a list to store process objects:
 
This list will be used to store the process objects created for each worker.

9.	Create and start processes:
 
This loop creates a multiprocessing.Process object for each chunk of data. Each process will execute the worker function with its corresponding chunk and the result queue. The processes are then started.

10.	Wait for all processes to finish:
 
This loop waits for all processes to complete before moving on. The join() method blocks the execution until the process finishes.

11.	Retrieve results from the queue:
 
The main process retrieves the partial results from the queue using the get() method until the queue is empty.

12.	Aggregate the results:
 
Finally, the script aggregates the partial results to calculate the total sum and prints the result.
This script demonstrates the parallel processing of a large dataset by dividing it into smaller chunks and processing those chunks concurrently using multiple processes. The use of a Multiprocessing Queue facilitates shared memory for communication between processes, allowing them to share data efficiently.
